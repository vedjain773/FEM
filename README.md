# Frontend Mentor – Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a wide range of challenges from  
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

The projects here span from small HTML/CSS components to full interactive applications built with modern frameworks. The goal is continuous improvement in layout precision, responsiveness, accessibility, and overall front-end architecture.

## 📁 Repository Overview

Each folder represents **one Frontend Mentor challenge** and is fully self-contained.

Most challenges follow the classic structure:

- `index.html`
- `style.css` / `styles.css`
- `script.js` (where applicable)
- `assets/` or `images/`

Larger projects use frameworks and live inside nested app folders.
